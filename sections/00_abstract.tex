\section*{Abstract}
Any health-related issue must be accurately and promptly analyzed 
if it is to be prevented and treated. In the event of a critical illness, 
the conventional method of diagnosis might not be sufficient.
 A more accurate diagnosis than the traditional approach can be achieved by 
 creating a medical diagnosis system based on machine learning algorithms 
 for prediction of any disease. With the use of ML algorithms,
  we have created a system for disease prediction. 
  More than 230 diseases,their symptoms severity,their symptoms description and their symptoms precautions
   were present in 4 dataset that was processed. 
  The diagnosis system produces the condition that a person may be suffering 
  from,based on several symptoms.
